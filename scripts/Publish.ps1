.SYNOPSIS
    Packages a release and writes the manifest the program checks for updates.

.DESCRIPTION
    Builds the portable folder and the setup program, zips both, hashes them, and writes
    latest.json. With -Publish it also creates the GitHub release and pushes the manifest, which
    is what makes the update notice appear.

    The release goes to two repositories while copies built before 0.12.0 are still worth
    serving. Those ask the retired distribution repository for their manifest, so it gets the
    same tag, the same assets, and a manifest of its own naming its own copies. Pass an empty
    -MirrorRepo once that repository is archived, and the mirror step is skipped.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Publish.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    .\Publish.ps1 -Publish -SkipBuild -NotesFile dist\RELEASE_NOTES_v0.3.0-beta.md

.EXAMPLE
    .\Publish.ps1 -Publish -NotesFile dist\notes.md -CertThumbprint ABC123DEF456
