# Documentation

Everything written down about TTS Util Win, in one place. The
[repository README](../README.md) is the short version: what the program is, how to install it
and where to go next.

| Document | For | What is in it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Usage](usage.md) | Anybody using the program | The tab by tab manual |
| [Speed and machine requirements](performance.md) | Anybody wondering what it costs to run | Measured render speeds, the thread rule, minimum and recommended specs |
| [Build from source](building.md) | Anybody compiling it | The SDK, the scripts, the switches, the output |
| [Release](releasing.md) | Whoever cuts a release | Publishing, the update manifest, code signing |
| [Develop and test](developing.md) | Anybody changing the code | Projects, tests, git hooks, versioning |
| [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) | Anybody sending a change | Where a change belongs, the style, the commit format |
| [Changelog](../distribution/CHANGELOG.md) | Anybody wondering what changed | Every release, newest first |

## Elsewhere in the repository

* `voices/README.md` explains what makes a folder a voice, for anybody adding a model by hand.
* `distribution/README.md` is the readme that ships inside the program folder and the portable
  zip, written for people running the program rather than building it, and
  `distribution/CHANGELOG.md` is the changelog, which is also compiled into the program and read
  by the Updates tab. `distribution/retired-repo-README.md` is the landing page of the retired
  distribution repository, which is published nowhere else.
* `LICENSE`, `NOTICE` and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` travel with every build.
